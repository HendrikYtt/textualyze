Subtitles have a fascinating history, originating as intertitles in silent films such as *Uncle Tom's Cabin* in 1903. Today, they play a crucial role in enhancing accessibility and engagement, with studies showing a significant reliance on them among consumers. As video viewing habits evolve, understanding the importance of subtitles and incorporating them into your short-form content becomes essential.

## The History of Subtitles

The first attempts to communicate the performers' dialogue to the viewers were made soon after the development of the first film. They began with what is now known as intertitles: written or drawn text that was filmed and inserted between scenes in a movie. They were initially used as sweeping, evocative titles in Edwin S. Porter's *Uncle Tom's Cabin* <a href="#citation-1">[1]</a>. Since the titles were employed similarly to subtitles in newspapers, for example, starting in 1909, they were referred to as sub-titles.

## Why Subtitles and Captions Matter

A study conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) suggests that by 2050, nearly 2.5 billion people are projected to experience some degree of hearing loss <a href="#citation-2">[2]</a>. However, it's important to note that individuals without disabilities may also require subtitles for temporary reasons.

In 2019, Verizon Media and Publicis Media conducted research <a href="#citation-3">[3]</a> to examine the correlation between video viewing, sound, and captions. The study, which polled 5,616 US consumers, revealed several key findings:

- 69% of respondents reported watching videos without sound, relying solely on subtitles.
- 80% of consumers are more likely to watch an entire video when captions are available.
- 50% of respondents stated that subtitles are essential because they watch content with the sound off (McCue, 2019).

Imagine you're selling hot dogs. Instead of having text printed on your cart and flyers everywhere, you just stand outside and try to talk to people to buy your hot dog. You wouldn't do that, would you? So why should you not use subtitles to boost and elevate your content?
